  Hey <%= @user.name %>,
===============================================
<%= link_to @follower.name, "#{@follower_url}" %> just followed you on WeFeed.
That's awesome, because they find your posts, reposts and comments valuable and intresting.

To see all of your followers, you can go to your <%= link_to "profile page", "#{@user_url}" %>.

Thanks for being awesome, and have a great day!
